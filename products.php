					<h1> Ron Hedrick</h1>
					<span>Kelowna, BC</span>
				</div> <!-- subheader -->
				<p> Ron Hedrick was born in Vancouver in 1942 and currently resides in Kelowna, BC. Hedrick’s painting career commenced when he received instruction in painting from the noted landscape painter Karl E. Wood in 1968. In 1982, he had his first show at the Peters Gallery while residing in Kamloops, BC. By 1990 the demand for his work increased and his dream of becoming a professional artist was taking shape.</p>
				<p>Hedrick’s early work was noticeably influenced by fellow Canadian Tom Thompson's stunning colors and heavy impasto oils. As his craft developed, Ron's individual style began to take shape. Hedrick's work is now recognizable with its bright, sunlit colors and spontaneous, confident brushwork. An impressionist by style, and oil painter by medium, Ron captures a scene with a mastery that must be seen to be believed.</p>
